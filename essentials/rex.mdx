## How \$REX Staking Works

### Staking Process

2. **Receive Multi-Token Rewards**: Get daily rewards from penalty redistributions
3. **Benefit from Platform Growth**: Share in platform fee revenue via buybacks

<Note>
  \$REX staking follows the same 3-month lock period as other tokens, but provides enhanced reward opportunities.
</Note>

### Reward Distribution System

\$REX stakers receive rewards from multiple sources:

#### 1. Penalty Redistributions

When users unstake other tokens early, a portion of their penalties comes to \$REX stakers:

- **20% of staking penalties** from all tokens go to \$REX stakers
- **25% of vesting penalties** from all tokens go to \$REX stakers
- **Automatic distribution** based on your \$REX stake proportion

### Daily Reward Calculation

Your daily \$REX staking rewards are calculated as:

```
Your Daily Reward = (Your Staked REX / Total Staked REX) × Daily Reward Pool
```

**Example:**

- You stake: 1,000 \$REX
- Total platform REX staked: 100,000 \$REX
- Your share: 1% of all rewards
- If daily reward pool is 500 tokens, you receive 5 tokens
