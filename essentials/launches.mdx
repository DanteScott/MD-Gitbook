# Token Launches on Meme Dealer

Meme Dealer provides a comprehensive platform for launching Rune tokens on Bitcoin with built-in presale functionality and automatic liquidity provision. This guide will walk you through the entire token launch process from creation to going live on our AMM.

## What is Token Launching?

Token launching on Meme Dealer allows you to:

- **Create your own Rune token** on the Bitcoin blockchain
- **Run a presale** to raise initial funds and build community
- **Automatically migrate to our AMM** for trading after presale completion
- **Build a DAO** around your token with voting and governance features

<Note>
All tokens launched on Meme Dealer use the Bitcoin Runes protocol, ensuring security and decentralization while maintaining compatibility with the Bitcoin ecosystem.
</Note>

## How Token Launches Work

### The Complete Launch Process

1. **Token Creation**: Define your token's properties and upload branding
2. **Presale Phase**: Run a time-limited presale to raise initial capital
3. **Automatic Migration**: If presale succeeds, your token automatically gets liquidity on our AMM
4. **Trading Goes Live**: Your token becomes tradeable by the entire Meme Dealer community

### Presale Difficulty Levels

Meme Dealer offers four difficulty levels for your token presale, each with different caps and time limits:

- **Easy**: Lower presale cap, shorter duration - perfect for testing the waters
- **Medium**: Moderate presale goals for established communities
- **Hard**: Higher caps for ambitious projects with strong backing
- **Nightmare**: Maximum difficulty for the most confident creators

<Tip>
Choose your difficulty level carefully! Higher difficulties offer more potential funding but require stronger community support to succeed.
</Tip>

## Step-by-Step Launch Guide

### Step 1: Prepare Your Token

Before launching, make sure you have:

- ✅ **A unique token name and symbol**
- ✅ **A compelling description** explaining your token's purpose
- ✅ **High-quality token image** (under 5MB)
- ✅ **Social media links** (Twitter, Telegram, website - optional but recommended)
- ✅ **Sufficient Bitcoin** to cover launch fees

### Step 2: Connect Your Wallet

1. Go to the **"Launch Token"** page on Meme Dealer
2. Connect your Bitcoin wallet (Unisat, Xverse, etc.)
3. Ensure your wallet has enough Bitcoin for launch fees

### Step 3: Fill Out the Launch Form

#### Required Information:

**Token Details:**
- **Token Name**: Your token's display name (e.g., "My Awesome Token")
- **Symbol**: Short ticker symbol (e.g., "MAT")
- **Description**: Explain what your token represents and its purpose

**Rune Selection:**
- Choose an existing Rune from your wallet, or
- Create a new Rune through our Rune Etch service

**Presale Configuration:**
- **Difficulty Level**: Select Easy, Medium, Hard, or Nightmare
- **Launch Date**: Set when your presale should begin

#### Optional Enhancements:

<Accordion title="Social Media Links">
- **Twitter**: Link to your project's Twitter account
- **Telegram**: Invite link to your community chat
- **Website**: Your project's official website

These links help build trust and allow investors to research your project.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Advanced Options">
- **Custom mint start date**: Schedule your presale for optimal timing
- **Additional metadata**: Extra information about your token's properties
</Accordion>

### Step 4: Upload Token Image

Your token image is crucial for recognition and branding:

- **Supported formats**: PNG, JPG, GIF
- **Maximum size**: 5MB
- **Recommended dimensions**: 512x512 pixels or higher
- **Best practices**: Use clear, recognizable imagery that represents your token

### Step 5: Review and Submit

1. **Double-check all information** - changes may not be possible after launch
2. **Review the presale terms** and difficulty requirements
3. **Confirm transaction** in your connected wallet
4. **Wait for confirmation** - your token will appear with "Pending" status initially

## Understanding Presale Mechanics

### How Presales Work

1. **Presale Period**: Users can invest Bitcoin during the set timeframe
2. **Cap Requirements**: Each difficulty level has minimum investment caps
3. **Success Criteria**: Presale must reach its cap within the time limit
4. **Automatic Processing**: Successful presales automatically migrate to AMM trading

### What Happens After Presale

#### If Presale Succeeds:
- ✅ Liquidity pool is automatically created
- ✅ Your token goes live for trading
- ✅ Investors receive their tokens
- ✅ You receive the raised Bitcoin (minus platform fees)

#### If Presale Fails:
- ❌ All investor funds are automatically refunded
- ❌ Token does not go live for trading
- ❌ You can try launching again with different parameters

<Warning>
Failed presales are automatically processed by our system. All Bitcoin invested is returned to participants without any manual intervention required.
</Warning>

Meme Dealer charges fees to cover:
- **Rune creation costs** (if creating new Rune)
- **Platform maintenance**

Fee structures vary by difficulty level - higher difficulties may have different fee schedules.
