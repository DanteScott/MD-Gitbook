# Token Launches on Meme Dealer

Meme Dealer provides a comprehensive platform for launching Rune tokens on Bitcoin with built-in presale functionality and automatic liquidity provision. This guide will walk you through the entire token launch process from creation to going live on our AMM.

## What is Token Launching?

Token launching on Meme Dealer allows you to:

- **Create your own Rune token** on the Bitcoin blockchain
- **Run a presale** to raise initial funds for your token's LP and DAO to kickstart the community
- **Automatically migrate to our AMM** for trading after presale completion
- **Build a DAO** around your token with voting and governance features
- **Staking/Vesting** for all tokens to encourage long term support.

<Note>
  All tokens launched on Meme Dealer use the Bitcoin Runes protocol, ensuring security and decentralization while maintaining compatibility with the Bitcoin ecosystem.
</Note>

## How Token Launches Work

### The Complete Launch Process

1. **Token Creation**: Define your token's properties and upload branding
2. **Presale Phase**: Run a time-limited presale to raise initial capital
3. **Automatic Migration**: If presale succeeds, your token automatically gets liquidity on our AMM, and a DAO seed funded instantly.
4. **Token Goes Live**: Your token becomes tradeable by the entire Meme Dealer community, a DAO is funded and launched for your token, and vesting/staking immediately becomes available.

### Presale Difficulty Levels

Meme Dealer offers four difficulty levels for your token presale, each with different caps and time limits:

- **Easy (recommended)**: Lower presale cap, shorter duration - perfect for testing the waters or higher volatility tokens.
- **Medium**: Moderate presale goals for established communities
- **Hard**: Higher caps for ambitious projects with strong backing
- **Nightmare**: Maximum difficulty for the most confident creators - more difficult but lower volatility for bonded tokens.

<Tip>
  Choose your difficulty level carefully\! Higher difficulties offer more potential funding but require stronger community support to succeed. We recommend choosing "Easy" for most cases.
</Tip>

## Rune Requirements: The Foundation of Your Launch

<Warning>
  **IMPORTANT**: You must have a Rune etched before you can launch a token on Meme Dealer. This is a mandatory requirement for all token launches.
</Warning>

### What is a Rune?

A Rune is a fungible token standard built directly on Bitcoin using the Runes protocol. Every token launched on Meme Dealer must be backed by a Rune, which serves as the underlying asset for your token's functionality.

### Two Ways to Get Your Rune

#### Option 1: Bring Your Own Rune üèÜ

**Perfect for collectors and advanced users who already own rare runes:**

- **Rare/Custom Rune Names**: Launch tokens with coveted names like single letters, numbers, or memorable words related to your brand
- **Rare Rune Numbers**: Own low-numbered runes (closer to Rune #1) for maximum prestige
- **Rare Sat Inscriptions**: Runes etched on rare satoshis (vintage sats, palindromes, etc.)
- **Historical Significance**: Runes from early Bitcoin blocks or special occasions

<Tip>
  If you own rare runes sitting in your wallet, Meme Dealer is the perfect platform to unlock their value through token launches and community building.
</Tip>

**Requirements for bringing your own Rune:**

- You must own the **complete supply** of the Rune
- The Rune must be in your connected Bitcoin wallet
- **Minimum supply requirement**: Rune must have more than 50 million base units (accounting for divisibility)
- **Divisibility requirement**: Total supply must be divisible by 100
- Meme Dealer will verify full ownership before allowing launch

<Note>
  **Understanding Supply Units**: Like Bitcoin (21M coins = 2.1 quadrillion satoshis at 8 divisibility), your Rune's total base units = displayed tokens √ó 10^divisibility. For example, 1M tokens at 2 divisibility = 100M base units.
</Note>

#### Option 2: Etch Through Meme Dealer üöÄ

**Perfect for new creators who need a fresh Rune:**

Meme Dealer offers integrated Rune etching powered by OrdinalsBot, allowing you to create custom Runes directly on our platform.

**Rune Etching Features:**

- **Custom Names**: Choose any available name up to 28 characters (letters, spaces, and ‚Ä¢ symbols)
- **Custom Symbols**: Select any single character or emoji as your Rune's symbol
- **Fixed Supply**: All etched Runes have a fixed supply of 100 million base units (meets platform requirements)
- **Platform Compliance**: Automatically meets the \>50M base unit supply and divisibility requirements
- **Immediate Integration**: Etched Runes are automatically available for token launches

**How to Etch a Rune:**

1. **Navigate to Rune Etch**: Go to the "Rune Etch" page on Meme Dealer
2. **Design Your Rune**:
   - **Name**: Enter your desired Rune name (e.g., "MY‚Ä¢AWESOME‚Ä¢RUNE")
   - **Symbol**: Choose a single character or emoji (e.g., ‚ö°, üöÄ, üíé)
3. **Connect Wallet**: Ensure your Bitcoin wallet is connected
4. **Create Order**: Submit your etch request and receive payment details
5. **Complete Payment**: Send Bitcoin to the provided address or pay via Lightning
6. **Wait for Confirmation**: Your Rune will be etched and sent to your wallet

<Accordion title="Rune Etching Costs and Timeline">
  **Costs:**

  - Etching fees vary based on Bitcoin network conditions
  - Payment can be made via Bitcoin on-chain or Lightning Network
  - All costs are transparently displayed before payment

  **Timeline:**

  - Payment confirmation: Usually within 1 block (10 minutes)
  - Rune etching: Completed within 6 blocks after payment (60~ minutes)
  - Delivery: Runes are sent directly to your specified Bitcoin address
</Accordion>

### Rare Runes: Why They Matter

**Rune Number Rarity:**

- Lower numbers are more prestigious (Rune #1000 vs Rune #50000)
- Early runes have historical significance in Bitcoin's Runes protocol

**Name Rarity:**

- Single characters (A, B, C) are extremely rare and valuable
- Short words and numbers command premium value
- Memorable phrases become community rallying points

**Sat Rarity:**

- Runes etched on rare satoshis inherit that rarity
- Vintage sats, palindrome sats, and block 9 sats add extra value
- These create unique collecting opportunities for your token holders

<Note>
  Meme Dealer is the first platform to let you monetize rare runes through token launches, turning collectible assets into thriving community tokens.
</Note>

4. **Wait for confirmation** - your token will appear with "Pending" status initially

## Understanding Presale Mechanics

### How Presales Work

1. **Presale Period**: Users can invest Bitcoin during the set timeframe
2. **Cap Requirements**: Each difficulty level has minimum investment caps
3. **Success Criteria**: Presale must reach its cap within 24 hours or Rune will go to the graveyard - and all investors automatically refunded.
4. **Automatic Processing**: Successful presales automatically migrate to AMM trading

### What Happens After Presale

#### If Presale Succeeds:

- ‚úÖ Liquidity pool is automatically created
- ‚úÖ Your token goes live for trading/staking
- ‚úÖ Investors receive their tokens
- ‚úÖ DAO is automatically funded
- ‚úÖ Vesting schedules begin for presale participants

#### If Presale Fails:

- ‚ùå All investor funds are automatically refunded
- ‚ùå Token does not go live for trading
- ‚ùå You can try launching again with different parameters

<Warning>
  Failed presales are automatically processed by our system. All Bitcoin invested is returned to participants without any manual intervention required.
</Warning>

A 5% fee is charged **only** to successful presales. If the sale does not migrate, we do not charge anything.

## Ownership Verification Process

<Note>
  Meme Dealer automatically verifies that you own the complete supply of any Rune you attempt to use for token launches.
</Note>

**How Verification Works:**

1. **Wallet Scan**: System scans your connected wallet for available Runes
2. **Supply Check**: Verifies you own 100% of the Rune's total supply
3. **Real-time Updates**: Rune list updates automatically when you connect different wallets
4. **Error Prevention**: Prevents launches with partial ownership to protect investors

**What Happens if Verification Fails:**

- You'll receive a clear error message explaining the issue
- **Common causes**:
  - Partial supply ownership (don't own 100% of tokens)
  - Rune not in connected wallet
  - Supply below 50 million base units (accounting for divisibility)
  - Total supply not divisible by 100
- **Solutions**: Transfer remaining supply to your wallet, choose a different Rune, or use our Rune Etch service

## Common Questions

<Accordion title="Do I need to own a Rune to launch a token?">
  Yes, owning a Rune is mandatory for all token launches on Meme Dealer. You can either bring an existing Rune from your wallet or create a new one through our integrated Rune Etch service powered by OrdinalsBot. We make it very easy to etch a new rune in only a few clicks directly through our Rune Etching page.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I use a Rune I don't completely own?">
  No, you must own 100% of the Rune's supply to launch a token. Additionally, the Rune must have more than 50 million base units (total supply √ó 10^divisibility) and the total supply must be divisible by 100. This ensures fair launches and prevents conflicts between multiple token creators using the same underlying Rune.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why does my Rune need more than 50 million base units?">
  Meme Dealer requires Runes to have more than 50 million base units (total supply accounting for divisibility) and be divisible by 100 to ensure sufficient liquidity for trading and fair token distribution. This prevents issues with extremely small supplies that could lead to manipulation or poor trading experiences.

  **Example**: A Rune with 1 million displayed tokens at 2 divisibility = 100 million base units (1,000,000 √ó 10¬≤), which meets the requirement.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What makes a Rune 'rare' and valuable?">
  Rune rarity comes from several factors: low Rune numbers (closer to #1), short or memorable names (single letters, numbers), and Runes etched on rare satoshis (vintage sats, palindromes). These rare properties transfer value to your token launch.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How much does it cost to etch a new Rune?">
  Rune etching costs vary based on Bitcoin network fees and are transparently displayed before payment. You can pay via Bitcoin on-chain or Lightning Network. Costs are determined by OrdinalsBot and current network conditions. Usually only a few dollars.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I change my token details after launching?">
  Most token details cannot be changed once the presale begins. Make sure all information is correct before submitting your launch. Some details can be changed through a DAO vote later.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens if my presale doesn't reach its cap?">
  If your presale fails to reach its cap within the time limit, all invested Bitcoin is automatically refunded to participants. You can attempt to launch again with different parameters. The rune itself will be moved to the graveyard. You can pay a gas fee to have your rune refunded and try the launch again later if you'd like.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How long do presales last?">
  Token presale duration is always 24 hours.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I launch multiple tokens?">
  Yes, you can launch multiple tokens. However, each launch requires a separate Rune and going through the complete process with associated fees.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens to my Rune after a successful token launch?">
  Your Rune becomes the underlying asset for your token on Meme Dealer's AMM. The Rune's properties and rarity contribute to your token's uniqueness and community value.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I view my Rune etching history?">
  Yes, Meme Dealer provides a complete history of your Rune etching orders, including status updates, payment confirmations, and delivery tracking through our integrated OrdinalsBot system.
</Accordion>
