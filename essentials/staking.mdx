## What is Staking?

Staking on Meme Dealer allows you to lock up your tokens for a period of time to gain voting power in DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations). When you stake tokens, you're contributing to the governance and decision-making process of the token's community.

### Key Benefits of Staking:
- **Voting Power**: Each staked token = 1 vote in DAO proposals
- **Community Governance**: Participate in important decisions about the token's future
- **Reward Eligibility**: Potential benefits from forfeited tokens when others unstake early

## How Staking Works

### Staking Process

1. **Choose Your Tokens**: Select any token you hold to stake
2. **Set Duration**: Stakes are locked for **3 months** by default
3. **Confirm Transaction**: Your tokens are moved from your available balance to staked balance
4. **Gain Voting Power**: You can now vote on proposals for that token's DAO

<Note>
You need at least **1 whole token** staked to participate in voting on proposals.
</Note>

### Early Unstaking Penalties

If you unstake before the 3-month period ends, you'll face penalties:

- **Penalty Calculation**: The earlier you unstake, the higher the penalty
- **Forfeited Token Distribution**:
  - 20% goes to REX token stakers
  - 50% goes to other stakers of the same token
  - 20% goes to the DAO treasury
  - 10% is permanently burned

<Warning>
Early unstaking can result in significant token loss. Plan your stakes carefully!
</Warning>

### Adding to Existing Stakes

If you already have tokens staked, you can add more tokens to your existing stake. The system uses **pro-rated expiration dates** to fairly calculate when your combined stake will expire.

## Understanding DAOs

Every token on Meme Dealer has its own DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization). DAOs are community-governed organizations where token holders make decisions collectively.

### DAO Features

Each DAO has:
- **Treasury**: Holds BTC and the DAO's native token
- **Governance Settings**: Rules for proposals and voting
- **Proposals**: Community suggestions for changes or funding

### DAO Configuration

DAOs have several configurable parameters:
- **Vote Requirement**: Minimum staked tokens needed to create proposals
- **Proposal Length**: How long voting periods last (default 24 hours)
- **Participation Requirement**: Minimum percentage of stakers that must vote
- **Chat Requirement**: Minimum tokens needed to participate in discussions

## Creating Proposals

Stakers can create two types of proposals:

### Configuration Proposals

Change how the DAO operates:
- Update DAO name or description
- Modify voting requirements
- Change proposal duration
- Update participation thresholds
- Modify token images/banners

### Funding Proposals

Request funds from the DAO treasury:
- Request BTC or the DAO's native token
- Specify recipient wallet address
- Set funding amount and purpose
- Must have sufficient treasury funds

<Info>
You can only have **one active proposal** per DAO at a time.
</Info>

## Voting on Proposals

### Voting Requirements

To vote, you must:
1. Have at least 1 token staked in the relevant DAO
2. Your stake must not be expired
3. You haven't already voted on this proposal

### Voting Options

- **For**: Support the proposal
- **Against**: Oppose the proposal  
- **Abstain**: Participate without choosing a side

### Voting Power

Your voting power equals your total staked tokens. If you have 100 tokens staked, you have 100 votes.

## Proposal Finalization

Proposals are automatically finalized when their voting period expires:

### Success Criteria

A proposal passes if:
1. **Participation**: Enough stakers participated in voting
2. **Majority**: More "For" votes than "Against" votes
3. **Treasury**: Sufficient funds available (for funding proposals)

### Automatic Execution

Successful proposals are automatically executed:
- **Config changes**: Applied immediately to the DAO
- **Funding transfers**: Tokens sent to recipient's wallet
- **Failed proposals**: No changes made

## Getting Started with Staking

### Step 4: Confirm

### Step 5: Participate in Governance
Visit the DAO page for your staked token to view and vote on proposals.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I stake multiple different tokens?**
A: Yes! You can stake any tokens you hold, and each gives you voting power in that token's DAO.

**Q: What happens if I lose my voting power?**
A: Voting power comes from staked tokens. If your stake expires or you unstake, you lose voting power until you stake again.

**Q: Can I change my vote after submitting?**
A: No, votes are final once submitted. Choose carefully!

**Q: How do I know if a proposal passed?**
A: Proposal status updates automatically when voting ends. Check the DAO page for results.

**Q: What if a DAO treasury doesn't have enough funds?**
A: Funding proposals will fail automatically if insufficient treasury funds are available.
