# Vesting on Meme Dealer

## Coming Soon

This page is under construction. Vesting functionality will be available soon on Meme Dealer.

## What is Vesting?

Vesting is a mechanism that allows tokens to be released gradually over time, ensuring long-term commitment and preventing immediate sell-offs that could harm token price stability.

## Features (Coming Soon)

- **Gradual Token Release**: Tokens are released according to a predetermined schedule
- **Investor Protection**: Prevents immediate dumps and promotes long-term holding
- **Flexible Schedules**: Different vesting periods for different participant types
- **Easy Claims**: Simple interface to claim your vested tokens when they become available

<Note>
More information about vesting schedules and claiming processes will be added as this feature becomes available.
