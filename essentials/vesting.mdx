# Vesting on Meme Dealer

Vesting is a reward distribution system that gradually releases tokens to users over time, for programmatic supply control supporting success of new tokens. When you participate in a successful presale on Meme Dealer, you will receive a vesting schedule that provide daily token rewards, encouraging long-term engagement with the platform.

## Presale Token Distribution

When you participate in a successful presale, your tokens are distributed as follows:

### **12.5% - Immediate Wallet Balance**
- Added directly to your wallet balance
- Available immediately for trading, staking, or other activities
- No restrictions or waiting periods

### **4.4% - Immediate Vesting Claim**
- Available to withdraw immediately from your vesting schedule
- Can be claimed right after presale completion
- No penalties for immediate withdrawal

### **83.1% - Future Vesting Rewards**
- Locked in your vesting schedule
- Released gradually through daily rewards over approximately 60 days
- Subject to epoch-based halving that may reduce rewards over time

<Note>
  **Total: 100%** - All percentages are based on your individual token allocation from the presale.
</Note>

## What is Vesting?

Vesting schedules are time-based reward systems that:

- **Distribute Daily Rewards**: Automatically add tokens to your claimable balance every 24 hours
- **Encourage Long-term Participation**: Reward consistent engagement with token projects
- **Provide Predictable Income**: Give you a steady stream of token rewards over time
- **Support Project Growth**: Help maintain token value through controlled distribution

<Note>
  Vesting schedules are created only when you participate in token presales.

## How Vesting Works

### Vesting Schedule Components

Each vesting schedule contains:

- **Token Name**: The specific token you'll receive rewards in
- **Total Possible Rewards**: Maximum tokens you can earn from this schedule
- **Current Vesting Rewards**: Tokens currently available to withdraw
- **Daily Reward Amount**: Tokens added to your balance each day

### Daily Reward Distribution

The system automatically processes vesting rewards:

1. **Daily Processing**: Rewards are distributed once every 24 hours
2. **Automatic Addition**: Your daily rewards are automatically added to your claimable amount
3. **Vesting Completion**: When you have received all of your vesting rewards, the schedule becomes inactive and the tokens will be added to your balance automatically (no claiming required)

### Epoch-Based Halving

Vesting rewards may decrease over time through epoch cycles:

- **Epoch Duration**: 30 days 
- **Halving Events**: Daily rewards will be reduced or eliminated after each epoch
- **Automatic Adjustment**: The system applies halving factors without user intervention

<Warning>
  Halving cycles can significantly reduce your daily rewards. Check your vesting schedules regularly to understand current reward rates.
</Warning>

## Managing Your Vesting Schedules

### Viewing Your Schedules

To see your active vesting schedules:

1. Navigate to the Meme Dealer dashboard
2. Look for the "Rewards" page to see your reward history
3. Alternatively search for the token using the top search bar to see details including:
   - Current claimable balance
   - Daily reward amounts
   - Remaining total rewards
   - Schedule status

### Claiming Vested Tokens

You have two options for accessing your vested tokens:

#### 1. Automatic Transfer (Recommended)

When your vesting schedule completes naturally (approx. 6 months to full completion):

- All remaining `currentVestingRewards` automatically transfer to your wallet
- No penalties or fees apply
- Full reward amount is preserved

#### 2. Early Withdrawal (With Penalties)

You can withdraw vested tokens before completion, but with consequences:

**Penalty Structure:**

- **20% to REX stakers**: Redistributed to REX token holders
- **35% to token stakers**: Given to other stakers of the same token
- **25% to DAO**: Added to the token's DAO treasury
- **20% burned**: Permanently removed from circulation

**Proportional Reduction:**

- Your future daily reward amount is reduced proportionally
- Early withdrawal may cause your schedule to become inactive

<Warning>
  Early withdrawal can result in losing significant portion of your future rewards to penalties. You may withdraw early, but first it is important to understand the risks of doing so.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

### Maximizing Your Rewards

<Tip>
  **Let Schedules Complete**: Allow vesting schedules to finish naturally to avoid penalties and receive full rewards.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Monitor Epochs**: Keep track of halving events that may reduce your daily rewards over time.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Plan Withdrawals**: If you must withdraw early, calculate the penalty costs versus your immediate needs.
</Tip>

### Understanding Penalties

Before making an early withdrawal:

1. **Calculate True Cost**: Remember that future rewards will be lost to penalties. The app will calculate and display this penalty for you before hand to help in your evaluation
2. **Consider Timing**: Withdrawing closer to schedule completion minimizes total loss
3. **Review Alternatives**: Consider if other funding sources might be available
