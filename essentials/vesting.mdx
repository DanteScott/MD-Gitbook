# Vesting on Meme Dealer

Vesting is a reward distribution system that gradually releases tokens to users over time. When you participate in certain activities on Meme Dealer, you may receive vesting schedules that provide daily token rewards, encouraging long-term engagement with the platform.

## What is Vesting?

Vesting schedules are time-based reward systems that:

- **Distribute Daily Rewards**: Automatically add tokens to your claimable balance every 24 hours
- **Encourage Long-term Participation**: Reward consistent engagement with token projects
- **Provide Predictable Income**: Give you a steady stream of token rewards over time
- **Support Project Growth**: Help maintain token value through controlled distribution

<Note>
  Vesting schedules are typically created when you participate in token presales, contribute to DAOs, or engage in other platform activities that qualify for long-term rewards.
</Note>

## How Vesting Works

### Vesting Schedule Components

Each vesting schedule contains:

- **Token Name**: The specific token you'll receive rewards in
- **Total Possible Rewards**: Maximum tokens you can earn from this schedule
- **Current Vesting Rewards**: Tokens currently available to withdraw
- **Daily Reward Amount**: Tokens added to your balance each day
- **Status**: Active (earning rewards) or Inactive (completed/stopped)

### Daily Reward Distribution

The system automatically processes vesting rewards:

1. **Daily Processing**: Rewards are distributed once every 24 hours
2. **Automatic Addition**: Your `dailyRewardAmount` is added to `currentVestingRewards`
3. **Balance Reduction**: The same amount is subtracted from `totalPossibleRewards`
4. **Completion Check**: When `totalPossibleRewards` reaches zero, the schedule becomes inactive

### Epoch-Based Halving

Vesting rewards may decrease over time through epoch cycles:

- **Epoch Duration**: 30 days in production (shorter in testing)
- **Halving Events**: Daily rewards may be reduced or eliminated after each epoch
- **Automatic Adjustment**: The system applies halving factors without user intervention

<Warning>
  Halving can significantly reduce your daily rewards. Check your vesting schedules regularly to understand current reward rates.
</Warning>

## Managing Your Vesting Schedules

### Viewing Your Schedules

To see your active vesting schedules:

1. Navigate to your account dashboard
2. Look for the "Vesting" or "Rewards" section
3. View details including:
   - Current claimable balance
   - Daily reward amounts
   - Remaining total rewards
   - Schedule status

### Claiming Vested Tokens

You have two options for accessing your vested tokens:

#### 1. Automatic Transfer (Recommended)

When your vesting schedule completes naturally:
- All remaining `currentVestingRewards` automatically transfer to your wallet
- No penalties or fees apply
- Full reward amount is preserved

#### 2. Early Withdrawal (With Penalties)

You can withdraw vested tokens before completion, but with consequences:

**Penalty Structure:**
- **20% to REX stakers**: Redistributed to REX token holders
- **35% to token stakers**: Given to other stakers of the same token  
- **25% to DAO**: Added to the token's DAO treasury
- **20% burned**: Permanently removed from circulation

**Proportional Reduction:**
- Your future `dailyRewardAmount` is reduced proportionally
- `totalPossibleRewards` decreases based on withdrawal amount
- Early withdrawal may cause your schedule to become inactive

<Warning>
  Early withdrawal can result in losing 80% of your withdrawn amount to penalties. Only withdraw early if absolutely necessary.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

### Maximizing Your Rewards

<Tip>
  **Let Schedules Complete**: Allow vesting schedules to finish naturally to avoid penalties and receive full rewards.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Monitor Epochs**: Keep track of halving events that may reduce your daily rewards over time.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Plan Withdrawals**: If you must withdraw early, calculate the penalty costs versus your immediate needs.
</Tip>

### Understanding Penalties

Before making an early withdrawal:

1. **Calculate True Cost**: Remember that 80% of withdrawn tokens are lost to penalties
2. **Consider Timing**: Withdrawing closer to schedule completion minimizes total loss
3. **Review Alternatives**: Consider if other funding sources might be available

## Frequently Asked Questions
