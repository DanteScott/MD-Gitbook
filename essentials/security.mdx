At Meme Dealer, the security of your funds and personal information is our highest priority. We've implemented comprehensive security measures and undergone rigorous testing to ensure you can trade with confidence.

## Custodial Platform with Industry-Leading Security

Meme Dealer operates as a **custodial platform**, meaning we securely manage and safeguard your assets on your behalf. While this approach differs from self-custody solutions, we've implemented the same rigorous security practices used by industry leaders like **Coinbase** and **Binance**.

### Our Proven Track Record

Our team brings **8 years of perfect security** to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Under our previous company **Onessus**, we've built and operated DeFi applications for nearly a decade **without ever experiencing a single exploit** that resulted in the loss of user funds.

<Info>
You can research our track record and verify our commitment to security by looking into Onessus's history in the blockchain space.

### Two Full Platform Audits by Leading Firms

- **CertiK** - Renowned blockchain security firm trusted by major Bitcoin ecosystem projects
- **Halborn** - Premier cybersecurity firm specializing in blockchain technologies

These auditing firms are the same trusted partners used by major Bitcoin ecosystem companies including:

- **TRAC Network** (Bitcoin scaling solutions)
- **OKX** (Tier 1 CEX Supporting Bitcoin Eco Projects)

## Responsible Use Guidelines

<Warning>
**Important Safety Reminder**

While we maintain the highest security standards, Bitcoin Runes and Meme Dealer represent emerging technology in the cryptocurrency space. As with any new technology or investment:

- **Never invest more than you can afford to lose**
- **Do your own research** before making any trades
- **Start with small amounts** to familiarize yourself with the platform
- **Keep track of your transactions** and trading activity
</Warning>

The Bitcoin Runes ecosystem is still **relatively new** compared to more established areas of cryptocurrency. While this presents exciting opportunities, it also means users should exercise appropriate caution and make informed decisions.

## Continuous Security Improvement

Security is not a one-time implementation but an ongoing commitment. We continuously:

- **Monitor for new threats** and update our defenses accordingly
- **Regular security assessments** and code reviews
- **Stay current with best practices** in blockchain security
- **Maintain transparency** with our community about security measures

<Info>
If you ever have security concerns or questions, our team is committed to addressing them promptly and transparently.
