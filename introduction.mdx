## Using The Platform

Here you can swap and rapidly launch Bitcoin Runes using our new Perfect Fair Launch mechanism. 

Perfect Fair Launches serve the purpose to fully block soft rugs _(dev selling, insiders/snipers/bundlers selling)_ â€” and offer many other investor protections. 

**Every token launched starts off 100X stronger on Meme Dealer vs other platforms. ðŸš€**

## Make it yours

Every token that bonds on Meme Dealer will instantly get a seed funded DAO for the community to earn, in addition to staking, vesting and a seeded LP within the platform. All of this on day one, for every bonded coin. 

These elements come together to create a **Perfect Fair Launch.**
